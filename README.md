# QGIS_1_WIRE_model
SASSCAL Weathernet Year_Meteo_data_collection

This QGIS model is a tool to access SASSCAL Weathernet Automatic Weather Station (AWS) data and import it to the user's machine for further analysis. It was made to support the development of tasks within the WIRE project (and others), under the SASSCAL 2.0 portfolio.

The current version (V0) only supports a limited number of AWS stations, but serves as the blueprint for scaling to the entire platform. It is available as *.model3 and .py formats. These must be loaded into a QGIS project to run.
